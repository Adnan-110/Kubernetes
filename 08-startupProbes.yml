# Purpose of Startup Probes:
#   Detection: Startup probes detect when a containerâ€™s workload has launched and the container is ready to handle requests.
#   Health Check: They serve as a health check for your application during its initial moments.
#   Avoid Interference: Importantly, startup probes ensure that liveness and readiness probes do not start until the startup probe succeeds. This prevents interference with the application startup process.
# How It Works:
#   When a pod starts, the kubelet waits for the startup probe to succeed before initiating liveness and readiness probes.
#   This approach prevents premature killing of containers during slow startup, allowing them to become fully operational before being checked for liveness or readiness.
