### Storage Class

# 1. Storage Classes:
#    - A StorageClass in Kubernetes is an API object that allows administrators to describe the classes of storage they offer. These classes can map to different quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or other arbitrary policies determined by cluster administrators.
#    - Unlike Deployments, which are more suitable for stateless workloads, StatefulSets, which we discussed earlier, are designed for stateful applications. StatefulSets ensure stable identities for Pods and provide persistent storage.
#    - Each StorageClass contains essential fields like provisioner, parameters, and reclaimPolicy. These fields come into play when a PersistentVolume (PV) belonging to the class needs to be dynamically provisioned to satisfy a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).

# 2. Sample StorageClass Manifest:
#    Below is an example of a StorageClass manifest:

# ```yaml
# apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
# kind: StorageClass
# metadata:
#   name: low-latency
#   annotations:
#     storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class: "false"
# provisioner: csi-driver.example-vendor.example
# reclaimPolicy: Retain # Default value is Delete
# allowVolumeExpansion: true
# mountOptions:
#   - discard # This might enable UNMAP / TRIM at the block storage layer
# volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
# parameters:
#   guaranteedReadWriteLatency: "true" # Provider-specific
# ```

# In this example:
# - The provisioner specifies the storage driver (e.g., CSI driver).
# - reclaimPolicy determines whether to retain or delete the PV when released.
# - allowVolumeExpansion enables volume resizing.
# - mountOptions can include additional options like enabling UNMAP/TRIM.
# - parameters are provider-specific settings.

# 3. Default StorageClass:
#    You can mark a StorageClass as the default for your cluster. When a PVC doesn't specify a `storageClassName`, the default StorageClass is used. Note that having multiple default StorageClasses allows for seamless migration.

# Remember, StorageClasses play a crucial role in managing storage for your Kubernetes workloads!
